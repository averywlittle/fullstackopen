# Full Stack Open
https://fullstackopen.com/en/

I use AngularJS and ASP.NET for my day job. I'm looking to learn newer web technologies and better techniques for web development.
This course comes highly recommended for those who already have some coding experience.

UPDATE

As of 1/20/21 I've finished part 7, a total of 8 parts, that makes up the core of the course. I've put over 100 hours into this course. The remaining parts are:
Part 8: GraphQL
Part 9: TypeScript
Part 10: React Native
Part 11: CI/CD

I've been working on this for about two months, and I'm going to shift focus and work on some vanilla frontend practice to take a break from React.
I will then do a project to utilize the stack I learned in this course, but trade out MongoDB for Posgres. I want more practice designing, implementing, and deploying SQL databases. After that project, I will return and for sure do parts 8, 10, and 11. I don't have any projects in mind that would utilize React Native. If I ever come across that in mobile work then I will revisit that part first.

I feel I've learned enough to move on for now. This course has changed how I debug across the stack, now that I understand REST architecture more thoroughly. I feel I need more practice with the vanilla DOM stack (html, css, and javascript) to really flesh out my understand of the front end. I'm very close to feeling like I can do anything on the frontend. The backend is a different story! Definitely need more practice.
